# Lua To DO 

A simple todo app implementation, written in Lua. Used as my personal task management system. 

To run, first, ensure that you have Lua installed 

on Linux:
```
sudo apt install lua5.4
```

on Windows:
```
winget install "Lua for Windows"
```

once installed, run:
```
git clone https://github.com/jinine/lua-todo
cd lua-todo
```

then run:
```
lua main.lua
```
